## ABOUT

After a decade in finance & risk management (**KPMG** & accounting and working banking sector), I founded **[Photini Family™](https://www.photini.family)** in 2025—an ecosystem combining **AI innovation**, **child protection advocacy**, and **trauma-informed technology**.

**My mission:** Create systems that embed human rights into their architecture—not as an afterthought.

🚀 Building Photini's Go-Driver    → AI-powered legal aid toolkit (GDPR/ISO-compliant)
📚 Writing Cosmic Bear Adventure   → Children's book series on hope & family separation
🔍 Researching Nordic Discrimination → Evidence-based policy reform for child protection
🌍 Advocating Case Finland         → Systemic reform in immigrant family and children rights

## FEATURED PROJECT: Photini's GO-DRIVER

**[Photini's Go-Driver](https://github.com/Hidikoo/Photini-Go-Driver)** – Next-generation advocacy & compliance platform

**What it does:**
Go-Driver transforms how advocates protect vulnerable populations by turning scattered evidence and manual processes into a secure, AI-augmented system that never forgets, always audits, and puts victims in control. It's a AI-powered co-pilot for NGOs, lawyers, and grassroots defenders—designed to amplify their impact while protecting the people they serve.

Go-Driver solves the crisis of evidence fragmentation and accountability gaps in human rights work. It consolidates case files, maintains immutable audit trails, and provides AI recommendations—always with mandatory human review. Think of it as a compliance-first command center for advocates who can't afford to lose a single piece of evidence or make a single privacy mistake, an aid kit that combines international case law, latest research and your case evidence into one clear information package.

Go-Driver pioneers **Compliance-by-Design** architecture—where ethics aren't bolted on after development, but embedded in the database schema, API logic, and AI workflows from day one from the ground up. It empowers advocates with AI-powered case management, evidence synthesis, and workflow automation—while ensuring every decision is traceable, every access is logged, and every vulnerable person's data and rights are protected.

*Built on:*
- ✅ GDPR Art. 25 (Privacy by Design) from database schema up
- ✅ EU AI Act transparency & mandatory human-in-loop controls
- ✅ Trauma-informed NLP for vulnerable populations
- ✅ ISO 27001/27701/42001 compliance roadmap

It is built for NGOs, lawyers, and grassroots defenders who protect vulnerable populations—especially children and asylum seekers. It will later be developed to more wider use with its innovative design where it is suitable to solve many other problems among human rights, project management and human processes...

**Status:** MVP Q2 2026 | ISO certifications Q3 2026
